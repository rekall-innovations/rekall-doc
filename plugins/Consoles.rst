Similar to [cmdscan](CmdScan.html) the consoles plugin finds commands that
attackers typed into cmd.exe or executed via backdoors. However, instead of
scanning for **COMMAND_HISTORY**, this plugin scans for
**CONSOLE_INFORMATION**. The major advantage to this plugin is it not only
prints the commands attackers typed, but it collects the entire screen buffer
(input and output). For instance, instead of just seeing "dir", you'll see
exactly what the attacker saw, including all files and directories listed by the
"dir" command.

Additionally, this plugin prints the following:

* The original console window title and current console window title
* The name and pid of attached processes (walks a **LIST_ENTRY** to enumerate
  all of them if more than one)
* Any aliases associated with the commands executed. For example, attackers can
  register an alias such that typing "hello" actually executes "cd system"
* The screen coordinates of the cmd.exe console.


### Notes

This plugin is pretty fragile since it relies on reversed structures in
undocumented code. We are working on improving the situation here but there is a
moderate chance that it will produce no results or garbage results.
