This plugin displays all the page translation steps needed to resolve a virtual
address to a physical address.

### Notes

1. The plugin uses the current default address space to calculate the
   mapping. If you want to resolve the virtual address in a process space you
   will need to switch the process context first (i.e. use the
   [cc](SetProcessContext.html) plugin.
