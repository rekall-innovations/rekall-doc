This plugin uses the **PFN Database** to convert a physical page to its virtual
address. It is similar to the **pas2vas** plugin in this regard, but does not
need to enumerate all address spaces prior to running (so it is a bit faster).

### Notes

1. The plugin currently only works for kernel addresses and for 4k pages. So for
   example this will not work reliably for pool memory (since Pool is allocated
   in 2mb pages).

2. If this plugin does not work for a certain address, try to use the
   **pas2vas** plugin.
