A symbolic link is a kernel object which maps a device from one name in the
kernel object tree to another name. Often a driver will set up a symbolic link
to a "dos device name" to allow access to a kernel device from userspace.

For example, the pmem driver makes a symbolic link from **\GLOBAL??\pmem** to
**\Devices\pmem** so that a user space program can use the **CreateFile** API to
open a handle to **\\.\pmem**.

This plugin scans for **_OBJECT_SYMBOLIC_LINK** objects using pool scanning techniques.

### Notes

1. Like other pool scanning plugins, this plugin may produce false positives
   since it essentially carves **_OBJECT_SYMBOLIC_LINK** structures out of
   memory. On the other hand, this plugin may reveal symlinks which have been
   closed or freed.

1. The interesting thing about a symlink is that it contains the timestamp of
   when it was created. This can be significant when determining when the system
   was compromised.

2. Since the *symlinkscan* plugin carves out **_OBJECT_SYMBOLIC_LINK** objects
   it has no context of where in the object tree the symlink exists. Hence it is
   unable to show parent object directories. A better plugin to use is the
   [object_tree](ObjectTree.html) plugin.

### Sample output

Here we see the **symlinkscan** plugin detecting the pmem link.
