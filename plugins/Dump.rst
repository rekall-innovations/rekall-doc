If you need to produce a hexdump of a region of memory, use the `dump`
plugin. This plugin accepts a single symbol name or address in the default
address space (see the `cc` plugin).

The `dump` plugin will also show which symbol address is known to exist in every
offset displayed. This is done via the Rekall address resolver. If colors are
enabled, known symbols are highlighted in different colors both in the comment
field and inside the hexdump area itself.

In the below example we dump the 'SeTcbPrivilege' symbol from the nt
kernel. Also shown are other symbols located in the vicinity.
