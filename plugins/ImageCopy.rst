Rekall supports many different image formats. Image formats such as AFF4 and EWF
are very convenient for long term storage and archiving of images. However, some
other memory analysis tools do not support such a rich selection of image
formats and might not be able to directly analyze some of these formats.

Sometimes we might want to verify something with another tool, and the RAW image
format seems to be most widely supported. The `imagecopy` plugin copies the
current physical address space into a RAW file. It pads sparse regions with NULL
bytes.

Note that RAW images can not contain multiple streams (like the pagefile), nor
do they support any metadata (such as registers). Hence the RAW image is vastly
inferior. We do not recommend actually acquiring the image using the RAW format
in the first place (use AFF4 or ELF). However, if Rekall is run in live mode,
the `imagecopy` plugin will produce a RAW image of live memory.

In the following example we convert an EWF image to raw so Volatility can read
it:
