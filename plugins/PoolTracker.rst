The Windows kernel allocates memory from a shared pool. In order to track memory
leaks and to aid in debugging, pool allocations typically have fixed tags
indicating the component which allocated the memory. For example, in windows 8,
allocating an _EPROCESS struct will result in a pool allocation with a tag of
`Proc`.

To aid in debugging, Windows tracks pool allocation in a special table found by
the symbol **PoolTrackTable**. This table can show the total number of
allocation and deallocations associated with a particular pool tag.

From a forensic point of view, this information can be useful to assess the
number of outstanding allocations. For example we can see how many live
processes we expect to be preset.

### Notes

1. Just because the process is terminated does not mean the _EPROCESS structure
   is immediately deallocated. Windows might keep these structures alive for
   some time for various reasons. A discrepancy here is at best a hint that
   something does'nt add up.

In the above example we see that there are 48 outstanding *_EPROCESS* objects
and there are 48 members in the **PsActiveProcessHead** list.
