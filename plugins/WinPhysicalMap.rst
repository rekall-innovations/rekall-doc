This plugin will simply print the kernels idea of the physical memory layout on
a machine. Typically the physical address space is not contiguous (i.e. does not
have RAM chip mapping all address ranges between 0 and the maximum number). This
is because the BIOS needs to leave gaps for DMA devices to be mapped.

The BIOS sets up an initial mapping and communicates the mapping to the kernel
through a BIOS service call (Or EFI call) which can be done while the kernel
still boots (In real mode). The kernel then keeps this information and returns
it through the **MmGetPhysicalMemoryRanges()** function.

### Notes

1. It is rather easy to manipulate this information to subvert acquisition. Most
   acquisition tools use this information to determine where it is safe to read
   and to avoid reading from DMA mapped memory.
