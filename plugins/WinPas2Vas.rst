In virtual (or protected) mode, the CPU can not access physical memory
directly. Instead each memory access made by the CPU is translated using the MMU
into a relevant physical address. This translation is controlled by page tables
loaded in the memory address controlled by the CR3 register.

Each processes has a unique page table structure, and therefore a unique view of
physical memory. In order to know what physical address is mapped to each
virtual address you can use the **vtop** plugin. However, the reverse mapping is
not so simple - there can be many virtual addresses mapped to the same physical
address.

This plugin enumerates all virtual to physical mappings in one or more
processes. It then builds a large lookup table in memory to be able to reverse
the mapping. i.e. given a physical address, the plugin is able to determine the
virtual address that maps to it, and in which processes it exists.

Forensically this can be used if you find an interesting string in the physical
image (e.g. with a hex editor) and want to know which process has that physical
memory mapped. Another use case is to detect shared memory between multiple
processes.

### Notes

1. This plugin only enumerates the userspace portion of the process address
   space (since all processes share the same kernel address space).

2. The plugin may take a while to run while it builds its lookup table. The next
   time you run it it should be very fast. The lookup map is also stored in the
   session cache so you can use the **-s** parameter to store the session for
   next time.


### Sample output

In the following we see that the process `vol.exe` is a Wow64 process and maps
**\Windows\SysWOW64\ws2_32.dll**. We want to know who else is using this dll. We
first find the physical address of the mapped dll (note we need to switch to the
correct process context first), then we use the **pas2vas** plugin to determine
which other process has that physical page mapped.

We see that `Console.exe` also maps the same dll - probably since it is also a
Wow64 process which requires network access.
