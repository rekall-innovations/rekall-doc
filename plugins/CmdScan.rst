The cmdscan plugin searches the memory of csrss.exe on XP/2003/Vista/2008 and
conhost.exe on Windows 7 for commands that attackers entered through a console
shell (cmd.exe). This is one of the most powerful commands you can use to gain
visibility into an attackers actions on a victim system, whether they opened
cmd.exe through an RDP session or proxied input/output to a command shell from a
networked backdoor.

This plugin finds structures known as **COMMAND_HISTORY** by looking for a known
constant value (**MaxHistory**) and then applying sanity checks. It is important
to note that the **MaxHistory** value can be changed by right clicking in the
top left of a cmd.exe window and going to Properties. The value can also be
changed for all consoles opened by a given user by modifying the registry key
HKCU\Console\HistoryBufferSize. The default is 50 on Windows systems, meaning
the most recent 50 commands are saved. You can tweak it if needed by using the
--max_history=NUMBER parameter.

The structures used by this plugin are not public (i.e. Microsoft does not
produce PDBs for them), thus they're not available in WinDBG or any other
forensic framework. They were reverse engineered by Michael Ligh from the
conhost.exe and winsrv.dll binaries.

In addition to the commands entered into a shell, this plugin shows:

* The name of the console host process (csrss.exe or conhost.exe)

* The name of the application using the console (whatever process is using cmd.exe)

* The location of the command history buffers, including the current buffer count, last added command, and last displayed command

* The application process handle

Due to the scanning technique this plugin uses, it has the capability to find
commands from both active and closed consoles.


### Notes

This plugin is pretty fragile since it relies on reversed structures in
undocumented code. We are working on improving the situation here but there is a
moderate chance that it will produce no results or garbage results.
