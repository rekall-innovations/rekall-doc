The windows kernel has the notion of a **Kernel Object**. Objects are managed by
the kernel through a dedicated API. Kernel Objects are typically used to manage
resources which the kernel manages on behalf of user space, for example, open
files are managed via the **_FILE_OBJECT** object.

Objects can be named using a directory structure not unlike a
filesystem. Objects are placed inside an **_OBJECT_DIRECTORY** object which
contains other objects, including other directories. This means that named
kernel objects forma tree in memory.

It is possible to discover all currently in-use named objects by following this
object tree in memory, which is what this plugin does. This is an alternative to
the scanning approach employed by plugins like **psscan**, **driverscan** etc.

### Notes

1. The object tree only tracks named objects. So for example Process objects are
   typically not tracked here, but Mutants, SymbolicLinks etc are.

2. It is possible to filter objects by types. So for example to enumerate all
   Mutants one would use the **type_regex="Mutant"** option.

3. *SymbolicLinks* also contain the timestamp when they were created. Note that
   SymbolicLinks are typically used to provide userspace access to a kernel
   driver (via the *CreateFile* api), so a timestamp here is a good indication
   of when a driver was loaded.

In the next example we search for SymbolicLinks for the pmem device and discover
when the pmem driver was loaded.
