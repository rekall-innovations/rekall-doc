This module enumerates the active sockets from tcpip.sys

Note that if you are using a hibernated image this might not work
because Windows closes all sockets before hibernating.

_ADDRESS_OBJECT are arranged in a hash table found by the _AddrObjTable
symbol. The hash table has a size found by the _AddrObjTableSize symbol.
